# Storyline  
A single person thousands of years ago discovered and harnessed death magic and became the first Necromancer. After reaching the peak of his era he finally succumbed to old age and let his soul to rest. However, a couple thousand years later he awakens in a skeleton body that has been enslaved to a lich. Being stuck in the tomb of said lich, he must fight against its hords of undead to escape the fleeting clutches of losing his memory and succumbing to the liches control. 
# Gameplay
So far its a basic hack and slash where W A S D are the movement keys and space bar is to attack at the moment. In the future, may want to add a jumping option/animation and also add more diverse monsters as level are added. Also may give the character more abilites as they progress, as he regains some of his power from when he was alive.
